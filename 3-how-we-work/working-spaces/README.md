# Working Spaces

## Physical working spaces

We use different spaces through our partner network for:

* Co-working
* Specific needs and events
* Retreats

## Virtual working spaces

We use virtual spaces to emulate the feeling of working together and being together. We can see and feel each other's presence.

We check-in and check-out at the start and end of each day.
