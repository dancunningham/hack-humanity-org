# Hack Humanity

This is an experiment, inspired by and following the example of [Loomio](https://github.com/loomio/loomio-org/wiki) to see if we can open-source everything about our organisation.

This wiki defines what we do, how we structure our organisation, our ways of working and the tools we use.

This is a first cut of it - it will evolve!

It's designed so anyone can fork it, mix and match bits they like, and define their own organisation in an open source way!

## What is Hack Humanity?

Hack Humanity is a new kind of organisation - a purpose-driven, emergent, autonomous network of people innovating for humanity.
