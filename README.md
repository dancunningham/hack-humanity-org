# Hack Humanity - our organisational scaffolding

This is an experiment, inspired by and following the example of [Loomio](https://github.com/loomio/loomio-org/wiki) to see if we can open-source everything about our organisation.

This wiki defines what we do, how we structure our organisation, our ways of working and the tools we use.

This is a first cut of it - it will evolve!

It's designed so anyone can fork it, mix and match bits they like, and define their own organisation in an open source way!

## What is Hack Humanity?

Hack Humanity is a new kind of organisation - a purpose-driven, emergent, autonomous network of people innovating for humanity.

## What do we do?

We address [Grand Challenges](blob/master/1-what-we-do/challenges.md) in the world by taking on [Missions](blob/master/1-what-we-do/missions.md), running [Projects](blob/master/1-what-we-do/projects.md) to try new ideas and launching [Ventures](blob/master/1-what-we-do/ventures.md) to have impact at scale.

With do all of this using highly collaborative, optimised, efficient (and open source) [Way of Working](tree/master/3-how-we-work/).

We provide [Innovation Services](blob/master/1-what-we-do/services.md) using these same methodologies to enhance other organisations' abilities to rapidly innovate.

Read about our [Structure](tree/master/2-our-structure/) and the [Tools we use](tree/master/4-tools/).

Join us!
