# Grand Challenges

The Grand Challenges are the areas of human endeavour where we want to have impact.

Challenge teams do [missions](missions.md) to understand, analyse and ideate.

## Current challenges

* How might the very way that organisations work be open sourced?
* How might we scale up humanity's response to climate change?
* How might we apply the best tech in the world to conservation?
